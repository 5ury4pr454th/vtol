# Steps for coding rk4

# 1. Write the first order differential equation as a python function.
# 2. Call the function with function value at previous time step and the next time
#    step or space step as input as suggested in the RK4 formula.
# 3. Find all the kâ€™s and use them to find the approximated value of the function at
#    next time step/space step.
# 4. Repeat in loop
